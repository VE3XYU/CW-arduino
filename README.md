# CW-arduino
Very simple Arduino Uno CW practice tone generator

I used an Uno Rev 3; your pins may be different.

Connect one wire of your straight key to pin 7, and the other to ground
Connect one wire of your speaker to pin 9, and the other to ground. I also used a LM386 amplifier module but that's not required.

Change line 13 to your preferred audio frequency (in Hz). I deployed two of these as a demo for kids, so I set each one as a different frequency to help them differentiate sounds.
